# Instamart-Query-Optimizer

## Project Overview
This project focuses on optimizing e-commerce search queries by categorizing them into relevant product categories (e.g., Dairy, Bakery). Built with Python and Pandas, it processes raw queries, improves search relevance, and outputs results to CSV files for further analysis.

## Features

- **Search Query Categorization**: Automatically assigns product categories based on query keywords.
- **Data Processing**: Uses the Pandas library to handle and manipulate raw query data.
- **CSV Output**: Saves the categorized results in a CSV file for easy analysis and integration.
- **Scalability**: The categorization system can be easily expanded with more categories and keywords.
